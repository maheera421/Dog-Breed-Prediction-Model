# Dog-Breed-Prediction-Model
multi-class image classification  because we're trying to classify mutliple different breeds of dog.
We're going to go through the following TensorFlow/Deep Learning workflow:

Get data ready ( store, import).
Prepare the data (turning images into numbers and then converting them into tensors, splitting x and y labels, making our own validation set, converting data in form of tensors to tensor tuples than making data batches of size 32).
Choose and fit/train a model (setting input and output size and choosing a model from TensorFlow Hub).
Evaluating a model (making predictions, comparing them with the ground truth labels).
Improve the model through experimentation .
Save, sharing and reloading your model .
For preprocessing our data, we're going to use TensorFlow 2.x
For our machine learning model, we're going to be using a pretrained deep learning model from TensorFlow Hub. (transfer learning)
