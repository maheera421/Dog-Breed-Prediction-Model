# Dog-Breed-Prediction-Model
multi-class image classification  because we're trying to classify mutliple different breeds of dog.
We're going to go through the following TensorFlow/Deep Learning workflow:

Get data ready ( store, import).
Prepare the data (preprocessing, the 3 sets, X & y).
Choose and fit/train a model (TensorFlow Hub, tf.keras.applications, TensorBoard, EarlyStopping).
Evaluating a model (making predictions, comparing them with the ground truth labels).
Improve the model through experimentation .
Save, sharing and reloading your model .
For preprocessing our data, we're going to use TensorFlow 2.x
For our machine learning model, we're going to be using a pretrained deep learning model from TensorFlow Hub. (transfer learning)
