# 🐶 Dog Breed Prediction Model  

This project focuses on **multi-class image classification**, where the goal is to predict different breeds of dogs using deep learning. We leverage **TensorFlow and Transfer Learning** to classify images into multiple dog breeds with high accuracy.  

## 📌 Project Overview  

This deep learning project applies a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** to classify dog breeds. Using a **pretrained model from TensorFlow Hub**, we fine-tune the model to recognize and differentiate multiple breeds efficiently.  

The workflow follows the standard deep learning pipeline:  

1. **Getting the Data Ready** 🗂️  
   - Import and store dataset  
   - Load images and labels for training  

2. **Preparing the Data** 🔄  
   - Convert images into numerical tensors  
   - Split images and labels (X, y)  
   - Create a **custom validation set**  
   - Convert image tensors into **tensor tuples**  
   - Generate **data batches of size 32**  

3. **Choosing and Training the Model** 🎯  
   - Define input and output layers  
   - Use a **pretrained deep learning model from TensorFlow Hub** (transfer learning)  
   - Train the model using GPU for faster processing  

4. **Evaluating the Model** 📊  
   - Make predictions on new images  
   - Compare predictions with **ground truth labels**  
   - Analyze model performance using accuracy and loss metrics  

5. **Improving the Model** 🚀  
   - Experiment with different model architectures  
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters  
   - Optimize training strategies for better performance  

6. **Saving, Sharing, and Reloading the Model** 💾  
   - Save trained model for later use  
   - Reload model for future inference tasks  

## 📂 Dataset  

The dataset consists of images of **multiple dog breeds**, categorized into different classes. Each image is labeled with its respective breed, serving as the ground truth for training and evaluation.  

## 🖥️ Google Colab & GPU Usage
